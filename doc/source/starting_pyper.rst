If you followed the anaconda installation instructions, you can start the GUI as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    source activate pyper_env
    python -m pyper.gui.tracking_gui

.. warning:: On Windows, replace *source activate pyper_env* by *activate pyper_env*

.. note:: If you followed the legacy instructions, first cd to the folder with pyper, then:
    on mac, you may want to use brewPython.
    On windows, you may need a full path.

The graphical interface should now be started.
